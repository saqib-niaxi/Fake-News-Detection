# Fake News Detection System

![Fake News Detector Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/900x200.png?text=Fake+News+Detector) <!-- Optional: Replace with a custom banner -->

A machine learning-powered system to detect fake news articles by analyzing text input. This project fulfills Task 3 of my internship, demonstrating skills in text preprocessing, model training, and web app deployment using Python and Jupyter widgets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a model to classify news articles as "Real" or "Fake" using machine learning techniques and deploy it as an interactive web app.

**Dataset**: [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) (Note: Not uploaded due to size; link provided).

**Expected Outcome**: A user-friendly system that distinguishes genuine news from misleading articles with high accuracy.
