## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a model to classify news articles as "Real" or "Fake" using machine learning techniques and deploy it as an interactive web app.

**Dataset**: [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) (Not uploaded due to size; link provided).

**Expected Outcome**: A user-friendly system that distinguishes genuine news from misleading articles with high accuracy.
